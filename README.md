# GameBoyAdvance Album Player

This is a personal project that started after I discovered the Butano game engine.
I wanted to make a small project to see how I could use it and this is what came out.
The project is basically a music player for the GBA. I picked my favourite music band
and "ported" their last album to a .gba that could play in the real hardware.

I wanted to make the project a little generic for future albums that I might "port"
to a cartidge, but some compromises where made and some other things could be better optimized.
In general it plays without problems, the only thing I couldn't make it right is that
there is a delay when playing sound_items and I don't know why it happens right now.
